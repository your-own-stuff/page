Here we have a simple vitepress application.

## Development

1. Install the dependencies with

```bash
pnpm i
```

2. Run the dev server with

```bash
pnpm docs:dev
```

## Production Build

To create a production build run

```sh
pnpm docs:build
```

This will produce a static rendering of the docs in `docs/.vitepress/dist`
